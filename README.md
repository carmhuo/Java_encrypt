# Encryption and Decryption by Java
---
### This project show the three encrypt algorithms.
* Base64
* MD5  
* PBE

#### Base64

Base64 is a group of similar binary-to-text encoding schemes that represent binary data in an ASCII string format by translating it into a radix-64 representation. link [Base64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64)

#### MD5
The MD5 message-digest algorithm has been utilized in a wide variety of cryptographic applications, and is also commonly used to verify data integrity.link [MD5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5)

#### PBE
